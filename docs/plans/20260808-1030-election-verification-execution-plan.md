# Election Verification — Execution Plan

**Date:** 2026-08-08 · **Status:** **SLICE 1 AUTHORISED** by the Product Owner (investigation only; PO review gate before Slice 2). Slices 2–7 remain PROPOSED. · **Checkpoint:** `9a38c510`

> **Governing principle, adopted:** *"We are not trying to make Election tests green. We are trying to establish that the Election system is correct, that the tests actually verify that correctness, and that the authoritative Election Manifesto/Lifecycle is the source of every business decision that is supposed to depend on lifecycle."*
>
> **Slice 1 scope, as authorised:** inventory every Election test and map each to — lifecycle state · capability · business invariant · entry point/route · authoritative decision source · fixture · expected behaviour · actual behaviour · failure status · existing evidence · coverage gap. **Incorporate the already-proven classifications** from `PBDIGIT-48` and the four closed clusters rather than re-deriving them. **No code, no fixtures, no production changes, no legacy migration. Stop for PO review.**
**Implements:** `docs/publicdigit/backlog/full_discovery.md` (Product Owner's Full Discovery Plan, §1–19)
**Does not reopen:** `PBDIGIT-48` Option B · `PBDIGIT-59` · the four closed clusters

---

## Objective

Turn the Full Discovery Plan into executable slices **without re-deriving what is already evidenced**. The plan's own Definition of Done governs; this document is only *how* and *in what order*.

## What is already done — do not redo

| Plan section | Already satisfied by | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| §2 Freeze the authoritative model | `ADR_20260807_1500_Election_Lifecycle_Single_Source_Of_Truth` | committed |
| §9 Legacy-field migration inventory | `PBDIGIT-48` §Completion Report — 46 sites, four buckets | committed |
| §3 Classification (partial) | 4 clusters closed on proven mechanism | `9b95469a`…`edd6b551` |
| §11 Already-voted exclusion | `PBDIGIT-62` — fail-open guard fixed + regression test | committed |

**Anchor Track B to `PBDIGIT-48`'s existing four-bucket classification.** Re-running that inventory from scratch would discard evidence and re-open a closed decision.

## Sequenced slices

### Slice 1 — Master Matrix *(the plan's authorised next step; investigation only)*
Inventory every Election test · map test → capability/state/invariant · mark coverage gaps · fold the existing cluster classifications in. **Output: one matrix document. No code, no fixes.**
**Gate:** PO review before Slice 2.

### Slice 2 — Finish failure classification (~95 unclassified + GracePeriod)
Evidence-first protocol, unchanged: intent → actual lifecycle state → trace → rejecting boundary → classify. **Repair only after classification.**
**First item:** `ElectionGracePeriodUITest` — measure the request-time Gate subject before hypothesising.

### Slice 3 — Fixture rehabilitation (Track A)
Repair fixtures that assert a lifecycle state they never created. **Each repaired fixture asserts its resulting `ElectionLifecycle` state before asserting behaviour** — the guard that closed 8d and 8a.

### Slice 4 — Production defects, individually authorised
Each one: proven mechanism → smallest repair → RED→GREEN evidence → separate commit. **No batching.**

### Slice 5 — Track B: migrate remaining legacy business-decision consumers
From `PBDIGIT-48` Bucket 1 only. **Bucket 2 (demo) stays until `PBDIGIT-59`; Bucket 3 (display) stays until field retirement.**

### Slice 6 — New coverage (§6, §7, §8, §10, §12–15)
**Largest and least-defined scope.** Lifecycle state matrix · capability matrix · server-side enforcement · journeys A–G · entry resolution · voting integrity · audit determinism.
**Must be authorised as its own work package** — it is building, not repairing.

### Slice 7 — Sweep, mutation/negative testing (§17–18), closure review (§19)

## Risks I would flag before starting

1. **Slice 6 is a scope expansion, not a cleanup.** The plan's 8–10 day estimate looks optimistic against measured throughput: four clusters (~41 failures) consumed one long session, and ~95 remain unclassified. **Recommend estimating Slices 2–4 from Slice 1's matrix rather than in advance.**
2. **Green is not the target.** The plan says this; the failure modes proved it — `withoutMiddleware()` hid a production 500, and cluster 6's red tests *are* `PBDIGIT-48`'s completion signal.
3. **Recognition is not classification.** Four plausible hypotheses dissolved under measurement this cycle. Every classification needs a measured mechanism.
4. **`full_discovery.md` is untracked.** 28 KB of governing methodology outside version control. **Committing it is a PO governance decision**; placement derives from `php scripts/doc-placement.php`.

## Definition of Done

The plan's own (§"The final Definition of Done"), which this plan does not restate or weaken. **Green tests are one criterion among several.**

## Outstanding obligation carried in

Developer guides for `developer_guide/http/` and `developer_guide/models/` — production code changed in both areas and the guides were deferred, not written.
