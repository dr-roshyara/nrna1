I treated the uploaded file as the governing research instruction and performed the requested **historical evidence-recovery pass** against the earlier KnowledgeOS corpus. I excluded `three_model_convergence/` and did not use later 3MC conclusions as evidence for earlier claims. The uploaded mission itself explicitly requires chronological reconstruction rather than isolated-hit interpretation. 

One important result emerged: **the historical corpus contains substantially more relevant material than the previous F4-only pass suggested**, especially around persistence, transition, warrant, historical relations, checkability, and the `K_t`/state carrier question.

# 1. R0 / regression governance

## **FOUND**

The earliest relevant material is the `P-09` / `O-P08-1` line.

The historical record explicitly says that the **corpus itself had not established monotonicity** and that the direction language was absent. The later `INTAKE-001` ruling is a separate governance act.

The reconstructed chain records:

> `P-09.3 §13`: K2 was conditionally redundant only if K3 were universal over non-monotone transitions.

Then:

> `INTAKE-001`: `O-P08-1` resolves to “MD-018 permits no regression — the status chain is monotone forward-only.”

The important epistemic distinction is explicit: corpus evidence and governance stipulation are not the same thing. 

### Status

* **Corpus proposition:** `[EMP]` — monotonicity not established.
* **Governance ruling:** `[STIPULATED]`.
* **Derived consequences:** `[DER-S]`.

### Scope

Only the direction of the status chain.

The later reconciliation explicitly says that the ruling does not become corpus evidence. 

### Historical significance

This is important for F4-style state modelling because it establishes that **state transition direction cannot be silently inferred from observed records**.

---

# 2. K3a — prior-value retention

## **FOUND**

P-08 makes the transition-relative nature of persistence explicit:

$$
Persist(x,\tau)
\iff
x\text{ survives transition }\tau
$$

and explicitly says the persistence kernel is about what would be lost under a named transition. 

The same artifact explicitly defines:

$$
\tau_2 = \text{association change (re-disposition)}
$$

with an empirical witness. 

More importantly, the historical persistence analysis states that for definition re-disposition the required information is:

> current state + a transition record naming the **prior association and its warrant**.



The later witness formulation makes the smallest datum explicit:

> re-disposition appearing as deletion + creation → **prior association value, plus warrant for changing it**.



### Status

**FOUND**

### Epistemic status

The exact persistence obligation is `[DERIVED]` from the transition/loss analysis.

It is not merely a naming convention.

### Important boundary

The corpus does **not** say that a positive transition event is universally sufficient. The uploaded mission explicitly warns against assuming that. 

---

# 3. K3b — warrant retention

## **FOUND / PARTIALLY FOUND**

There are two distinct historical strands.

### Strand 1 — transition warrant

P-08 explicitly treats warrant as part of the information that must survive non-monotone transitions.

The later reconstruction records:

> `K3b` — transition warrant.

And:

> a warrant is an adjudication; decisions cannot simply be regenerated.



### Strand 2 — proposition/grounding independence

There is an older operation:

`Corroborate(A,e) → A'`

dated **2026-08-27**, in which new evidence supports an existing assertion and its evidence basis becomes richer. 

That is historically important because it demonstrates that the proposition and its grounding can vary independently.

### But `Fact = Proposition + Reason`

This is **not** equally strong.

The historical source containing the phrase explicitly frames it as:

> “I think…”

and subsequently says:

> “this is not yet a Kernel design.”

The later audit therefore classifies the equation as `[HYPOTHESIS]`, not an established kernel definition. 

The same source places Reason in three incompatible structural positions:

1. inside Fact;
2. as an input producing Fact;
3. beside Fact.



### Therefore

**Warrant as a transition-grounding concept: FOUND.**

**`Fact = Proposition + Reason` as a formal object definition: CONFLICTING EVIDENCE / NOT ESTABLISHED.**

This distinction is essential.

---

# 4. K4 — historical relations

## **FOUND**

The earlier persistence corpus already contains historical relations.

P-08 explicitly witnesses:

$$
\tau_{10}=\text{withdrawal/supersession of an assertion}
$$

and gives examples where assertions were withdrawn but **not deleted**. 

The later historical reconstruction separates:

| Relation         | Subject     |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| `supersedes`     | proposition |
| `invalidated-by` | ground      |
| `retired-into`   | identity    |

The three are explicitly treated as different historical relation types. 

### Strongest evidence

For supersession, the corpus demonstrates that retaining only “something was superseded” is insufficient; the superseded content itself can be necessary.

The three-assertion counterexample shows that the supersession topology cannot always be reconstructed from endpoints alone. 

### Retirement

`retired-into` is different.

The corpus has a proposed retirement ruling, but explicitly says:

> “no statement anywhere in the corpus permits or forbids retirement.”

and the proposal remains unadmitted. 

### Therefore

* **supersession:** FOUND
* **invalidation:** FOUND
* **retirement relation:** PARTIALLY FOUND
* **general lifecycle ontology:** NOT CLOSED

No collapse of these relations is justified.

---

# 5. K5 — checkability

## **FOUND**

This is one of the strongest historical areas.

P-07 already identifies:

> historical continuity = “same thing, changed state”

and distinguishes it from “new thing, related to old.” 

P-08 then gives concrete retention requirements.

For a measured occurrence, the minimum surviving information is:

$$
(\text{pattern},\text{scope},\text{corpus-state identifier},\text{result-as-cited})
$$

and the occurrence site list may be regenerated. 

For a definition, the minimum includes:

$$
(\text{identity},\text{text},\text{source},\text{current association},\text{warrant of any non-monotone change})
$$



This is much stronger than generic “keep provenance.”

### Historical checkability principle

The corpus also explicitly distinguishes persistence from physical storage:

> persistence is quantified over transitions; storage is quantified over locations.



### Status

**FOUND**

### But

The actual **implementation mechanism** for checkability remains architectural.

The historical material explicitly refuses to prescribe:

* event sourcing,
* append-only storage,
* temporal tables,
* database structures.



---

# 6. η and `C_KOS`

## **PARTIALLY FOUND**

This is considerably stronger historically than “nothing exists.”

The August 2026 contract series introduced an **EpistemicContract**.

The historical series records:

* `EpistemicContract`
* contract forms,
* `DeriveContract(G,S)`
* `Closed(EC)`
* requirement evaluation,
* contract status,
* contract versioning,
* provenance,
* authority,
* scope,
* time,
* dependencies,
* exceptions. 

The source-level chronology says the contract thread was born around **step-023**, where `EpistemicContract` was introduced and later expanded into the contract algebra. 

### η specifically

The historical evidence does **not** establish:

$$
\eta(G,IdealState)
$$

as a valid total mathematical function.

The earlier corpus instead distinguishes that from the richer:

$$
DeriveContract(G,S)
$$

where `S` contains normative sources such as Constitution, Policy, ADR, Rule, Scope, HumanInstruction, RiskModel, DomainModel, Law and Standard. 

### Status

* `EpistemicContract`: **FOUND**
* contract algebra: **FOUND**
* `DeriveContract(G,S)`: **FOUND as named construction/procedure**
* complete executable derivation: **NOT FOUND**
* η as total mathematical function: **NOT FOUND / proposed form rejected**
* closed `C_KOS`: **PARTIALLY FOUND**

This means the historical corpus contains a **contract substrate**, but not a fully closed `C_KOS` semantics.

---

# 7. `X_R` / `K_t` / `Δ_t` carrier

## **PARTIALLY FOUND**

The historical corpus definitely contains state-carrier concepts.

P-07 defines persistence identity as a stable designator carrying sameness across change and defines version as a designator for one state of a thing having successive states. 

P-08 then explicitly defines a transition-relative persistence relation and an empirical transition set.

But there are multiple carrier formulations.

For example, historical state work contains:

* knowledge state;
* `K_t`;
* state tuples;
* evidence tuples;
* Zero/knowledge-state structures;
* different candidate signatures.

The contract series itself records a state-equality question:

> `K_t = K_t′`

but does not make it a universal theorem; component-wise equality is tied to a chosen representation. 

### Therefore

**Carrier concept: FOUND.**

**One canonical mathematical carrier: NOT FOUND.**

This is precisely **PARTIALLY FOUND**, not absent.

---

# 8. τ₁ … τ₁₁ transition universe

## **PARTIALLY FOUND**

P-08 provides a historical transition universe with explicit witnesses:

* `τ1` — status change
* `τ2` — association change / re-disposition
* `τ3` — new definition
* `τ4` — glyph-membership change `[OPEN]`
* `τ5` — implementation change
* `τ6` — source re-marking
* `τ7` — rename/move
* `τ8` — corpus rescan
* `τ9` — establishment
* `τ10` — withdrawal/supersession. 

The later historical material adds `τ11` for identity retirement/merge, but explicitly leaves the governing retirement decision open. 

### What is missing

The earlier corpus does **not** provide a single formal transition function:

$$
\delta : X\times E\rightarrow X
$$

covering all τ classes.

Some are witnessed operations; some are descriptive transition classes; some remain open.

### Result

**PARTIALLY FOUND.**

---

# 9. Semantic equivalence / `K_t` / `Δ_t`

## **PARTIALLY FOUND**

The historical corpus contains several prerequisites:

### State equality

`K_t = K_t′` appears explicitly as a question in the state/evidence work. 

### Identity

The earlier P-06/P-07 work distinguishes:

* semantic identity,
* persistence identity,
* reference,
* address,
* version,
* historical continuity,
* provenance. 

### Replay

The contract corpus also contains replay/history material, including event identity and history append. 

### But

No earlier artifact found in this recovery pass provides a complete, explicit relation of the form:

$$
K_1 \equiv K_2
$$

with a closed semantic interpretation of Model-B `K_t/Δ_t`.

Thus:

**historical prerequisites: FOUND**

**complete F4 semantic equivalence: NOT FOUND**

Overall: **PARTIALLY FOUND.**

---

# 10. Minimality

## **FOUND — BUT MULTIPLE AND CONFLICTING FORMULATIONS**

This area must not be collapsed.

Historical material contains at least:

### Cardinality minimality

“how many cells?”

### Set-inclusion minimality

Every admitted capability is necessary.

### Semantic minimality

Whether semantic distinctions can be removed.

### Representation minimality

Whether different representations preserve the same obligation.

The historical P-08 lineage explicitly treats its five-capability result as a **lower bound**, not a minimality proof. 

Later persistence work also explicitly distinguishes different minimality axes. 

### Result

**FOUND**, but with **CONFLICTING / NON-COLLAPSIBLE formulations**.

No single historical “minimality” definition should be extracted.

---

# 11. Part XIX preservation theory

## **PARTIALLY FOUND**

The underlying preservation concepts are clearly historical:

* `Persist`
* survival across transition
* historical recoverability
* checkability
* provenance
* prior-value retention
* supersession retention.

P-08 explicitly frames persistence as a semantic/modal obligation over transitions. 

However, the exact Part-XIX vocabulary:

* `Adequate_P`
* `Preserve`
* `Recover`
* `Dist_EC`
* `EC`

is not uniformly source-defined in the earlier corpus.

The historical evidence therefore supports **the preservation theory**, but not a fully established Part-XIX formal vocabulary.

**Result: PARTIALLY FOUND.**

---

# 12. Four guarded invariants

## **PARTIALLY FOUND**

The four propositions are not equally supported.

### 1. Reachability ≠ Knowledge ∧ Investigation ≠ Determination

Related distinctions are historically present, but I did not find a single earlier artifact establishing this exact conjunction as a formal invariant.

### 2. Conflict ≠ Unknown ∧ Contradiction ≠ StateCollapse

The distinction is strongly represented in the epistemic-state work.

The contract material explicitly distinguishes `Unknown`, `Conflicted`, `Invalid`, `Blocked`, etc. 

But the exact four-part invariant was not found as one established proposition.

### 3. Adequacy ≠ Realization ≠ Minimality ≠ Q-Equivalence

The corpus clearly keeps several of these concepts apart, but I did not find the exact four-way invariant as an earlier canonical statement.

### 4. Focus ≠ Deletion ≠ RestrictionOfInvestigationSpace

Related preservation/restriction distinctions exist, but the exact invariant was not found as an established earlier proposition.

### Result

**PARTIALLY FOUND.**

Do not promote the four as a single historical invariant set.

---

# 13. Layer provenance

## **FOUND**

This is one of the most robust historical methodological findings.

The corpus repeatedly distinguishes:

* `[EMP]`
* `[DERIVED]`
* `[ARCH]`
* `[OPEN]`
* `[STIPULATED]`
* `[HYPOTHESIS]`
* `[REFUTED]`
* `[QUALIFIED]`.

P-08 itself already establishes the basic taxonomy:

> `[EMP]` evidenced · `[DERIVED]` logically required · `[ARCH]` design choice · `[OPEN]` unresolved. 

The contract/epistemic series subsequently makes the same discipline explicit.

### Result

**FOUND**

### Important qualification

The **taxonomy is historical evidence**.

Its use to classify a particular proposition still has to be performed against that proposition's own source.

---

# 14. Forgotten breakthrough arguments

## **FOUND**

The recovery uncovered several genuinely substantive historical arguments that are easy to miss through vocabulary search.

### Breakthrough A — persistence is transition-relative

$$
Persist(x,\tau)
\iff
x\text{ survives }\tau
$$

This is not merely a storage principle. It changes the object of analysis from “what should be stored?” to “what information would be lost under a specified transition?” 

### Breakthrough B — current state and historical retention are different

The historical corpus explicitly finds that current-state preservation and historical retention can vary independently. 

### Breakthrough C — `Corroborate` changes grounding without changing proposition

The 2026-08-27 operation:

$$
Corroborate(A,e)\rightarrow A'
$$

is explicitly described as supporting an **existing assertion** while enriching its evidence basis. 

That is historical evidence predating the later persistence derivations.

### Breakthrough D — checkability requires corpus state

The historical persistence work identifies the corpus-state identifier as the remaining datum needed to reconstruct measurements. 

### Breakthrough E — historical supersession cannot always be reconstructed from endpoints

The three-assertion topology counterexample preserves the need for explicit historical relation information. 

These are **historical arguments**, not newly derived by this report.

# 15. Formal F4 semantic bridge

## **NOT FOUND**

This is the most important negative result.

The historical corpus contains:

* state carriers,
* transitions,
* identity,
* historical continuity,
* replay,
* equivalence questions,
* evidence,
* warrant,
* contract structures.

But I did **not** find an earlier artifact that explicitly establishes a formal bridge of the form:

$$
\text{historical persistence/state model}
\longrightarrow
\text{Model-B }K_t/\Delta_t
$$

or:

$$
K_t/\Delta_t
\longrightarrow
Obs/Beh/Trace
$$

with all terms formally connected.

The historical `K_t` material and the persistence `K` material therefore remain **related evidence populations**, not an established semantic identity.

# A. Missing questions answered by earlier brainstorming

These questions now have genuine historical answers:

1. **What does persistence mean?**

   It is transition-relative survival, not physical storage. 

2. **What is needed for re-disposition?**

   Historical evidence identifies the prior association and its warrant as the relevant missing information. 

3. **What is required for historical checkability?**

   Pattern, scope, corpus-state identification and cited result are explicitly identified for measurements. 

4. **What is the status of monotonicity?**

   The corpus originally did not establish it; the later R0 position was a governance stipulation, not empirical discovery. 

5. **Are historical relations merely synonyms?**

   No. Supersession, invalidation and retirement are treated as different historical relations in the evidence. 

6. **Does the corpus contain an epistemic-contract substrate?**

   Yes: `EpistemicContract`, contract algebra, `DeriveContract(G,S)`, `Closed(EC)` and versioning are historically present. 

---

# B. Missing questions only partially answered

These remain historically grounded but incomplete:

1. **Canonical `K_t` carrier**
2. **Canonical `Δ_t` state semantics**
3. **Complete τ₁…τ₁₁ formal transition system**
4. **Formal `Adequate_P` / `Preserve` / `Recover` / `Dist_EC` vocabulary**
5. **Complete `C_KOS` construction**
6. **Complete η construction**
7. **Formal semantic equivalence over `K_t`**
8. **Unified semantic interpretation of proposition/warrant/reason**
9. **Exact four guarded invariants as one established invariant set**
10. **Canonical minimality notion**

---

# C. Missing questions genuinely absent from earlier brainstorming

Under the searched historical corpus, I found no established earlier source for:

1. **A complete F4-specific `Obs_F4(K)`**
2. **A complete F4-specific `Beh_F4(K)`**
3. **A complete F4-specific `Tr_F4(K,n)`**
4. **A formally closed bridge from `K_t/Δ_t` to `Obs/Beh/Trace`**
5. **A formally closed semantic-equivalence relation specifically over Model-B `K_t` candidates**
6. **A unique mathematical carrier/type for F4 `K_t`**
7. **A complete formal transition function for the entire F4 transition universe**

These should remain **NOT FOUND**, not “does not exist.”

---

# D. Earlier material that should now be supplied to the current KnowledgeOS research team

The following historical artifacts are particularly important.

### 1. P-06 — Persistence Identity Derivation

`16-P06-PERSISTENCE-IDENTITY-DERIVATION.md`

**2026-09-07 · ~20:41:16**

It establishes the identity/reference/continuity distinctions and the historical identity problem. The timeline confirms the artifact and timestamp. 

---

### 2. P-07 — Identity, Addressing & Continuity Derivation

`17-P07-IDENTITY-ADDRESSING-CONTINUITY-DERIVATION.md`

**2026-09-07 · ~20:59:38**

Particularly important for:

* state identity,
* version,
* historical continuity,
* reference,
* provenance.



---

### 3. P-08 — Minimum Persistence Obligations Derivation

`18-P08-MINIMUM-PERSISTENCE-OBLIGATIONS-DERIVATION.md`

**2026-09-07 · ~21:10:34**

This is probably the **most important historical artifact recovered by this pass**.

It contains:

* transition-relative persistence,
* `τ1…τ10`,
* prior-value retention,
* warrant retention,
* supersession retention,
* checkability,
* corpus-state requirements,
* distinction between persistence and storage. 

---

### 4. P-09 / O-P08-1 lineage

`19-P09-KERNEL-STABILITY-PRECONDITIONS-DERIVATION.md`

**2026-09-07 · ~21:19:30**

Important because it preserves the original epistemic status of monotonicity before the later governance ruling. 

---

### 5. `INTAKE-001`

Referenced as the governance ruling resolving `O-P08-1`.

Important specifically because it demonstrates the difference between:

**corpus evidence**

and

**governance stipulation**.

That distinction should be preserved rather than retrospectively treating R0 as empirical evidence. 

---

### 6. Historical `Corroborate` operation

`step-007`, **2026-08-27**

This predates the later P-08 derivation and contains:

$$
Corroborate(A,e)\rightarrow A'
$$

with new evidence enriching an existing assertion's evidence basis. 

This is particularly valuable because it is **actual earlier operational evidence**, rather than a later reconstruction.

---

### 7. Contract series — `025d` / `025e`

**2026-08-29**

These provide the historical contract substrate:

* `EpistemicContract`
* `DeriveContract(G,S)`
* `Closed(EC)`
* requirement types
* authority
* scope
* provenance
* versioning.



But the historical corpus itself also records unresolved parts, so these should be supplied **with their open status**, not promoted to a completed construction.

---

# Final synthesis

The historical recovery changes the picture in an important way.

The earlier corpus **does contain a substantial state/persistence semantic substrate**:

$$
\boxed{
\text{identity}
\rightarrow
\text{state}
\rightarrow
\text{transition}
\rightarrow
\text{loss}
\rightarrow
\text{historical retention}
\rightarrow
\text{warrant/checkability}
}
$$

It also contains an independently developed contract substrate:

$$
\boxed{
EpistemicContract
\rightarrow
DeriveContract(G,S)
\rightarrow
Closed(EC)
\rightarrow
evaluation/versioning
}
$$

And it contains historically earlier operational evidence such as:

$$
Corroborate(A,e)\rightarrow A'
$$

where the assertion remains while its evidence basis changes. 

However, **none of that should be silently converted into F4 semantics**.

The decisive historical gap remains:

> **No earlier source found in this recovery pass explicitly binds these historical state/transition/persistence constructs to one canonical Model-B `K_t` carrier and then provides a closed F4 observation/behaviour/trace semantics.**

That is precisely where the evidence boundary remains.

### Negative-result discipline

So the correct classifications are:

* **NOT FOUND in searched earlier corpus:** complete F4 `Obs` / `Beh` / `Trace`
* **NOT FOUND:** formal bridge from historical persistence semantics to F4 semantics
* **PARTIALLY FOUND:** `K_t` / state carrier
* **PARTIALLY FOUND:** τ transition universe
* **PARTIALLY FOUND:** `C_KOS` / η
* **FOUND:** transition-relative persistence
* **FOUND:** prior-value retention evidence
* **FOUND:** warrant/grounding evidence
* **FOUND:** historical supersession semantics
* **FOUND:** checkability/corpus-state preservation
* **FOUND but conflicting:** minimality notions
* **FOUND but epistemically heterogeneous:** proposition/reason/warrant material

## Recommendation

**NOT READY — missing evidence:**

**one canonical source-defined F4 `K_t` carrier + a source-defined F4 transition semantics + an actual F4 observation/behaviour/trace construction + formally sufficient satisfaction/contract semantics + an explicit formal bridge connecting the historical state/persistence substrate to Model B.**

No new theory has been derived here, and no historical hypothesis has been promoted to canonical KnowledgeOS theory.
