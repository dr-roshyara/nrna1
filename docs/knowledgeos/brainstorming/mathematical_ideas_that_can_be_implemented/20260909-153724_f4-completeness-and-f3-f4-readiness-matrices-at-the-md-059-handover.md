I treated **MD-058 and MD-059 as the frozen handover boundary** and used only their recorded evidence/provenance and the primary corpus sources they explicitly relied upon. I did **not** perform new theory, reconciliation, model selection, F3↔F4 bridging, external literature research, or implementation.

The decisive handover finding is:

> **F4 is semantically instantiated in form, but not closed enough to make its satisfaction semantics computable; and it is not yet typed into a common observation space with F3.**

The two remaining blockers are therefore distinct: **internal F4 closure** and **cross-model bridging**. MD-059 itself names both as separate, unauthorized next acts.

| **A** | Complete `K_t` variant census        | **PARTIALLY FOUND** | MD-059 establishes **9+ mutually unreconciled variants**, including UE-1/UE-2, but explicitly does not establish a complete exhaustive census. Only one of eleven named components is concretely typed.                                                                           |
| **B** | Component semantics for each variant | **NOT FOUND**       | Only `Σ_t=(A,S,R,V,C)` has a concrete typed definition, and that is inside only one variant. The remaining component semantics are insufficient for computation.                                                                                                                  |
| **C** | Relationships among variants         | **CONFLICTING**     | The variants are explicitly described as **mutually unreconciled**. No component-level consistency or mapping has been established. The same problem appears in the wider `K_t` family: shared notation does not establish structural identity.                                   |
| **D** | Corpus-grounded common semantic core | **NOT FOUND**       | The corpus establishes shared notation/shape around `K_t`/`Δ_t`, but no component-level common semantic core. MD-058 explicitly found no basis for treating the candidate family as one instantiated semantic object.                                                             |
| **E** | `R_t` semantics                      | **PARTIALLY FOUND** | `R_t`/`Req(EC_t)` is part of the frozen `Δ_t` construction and therefore exists as a formal input. But the satisfaction predicates underlying requirements remain multiply defined/contested; MD-058 records `C_KOS/⊨` and underlying predicates as unspecified.                  |
| **F** | `Sat(K_t,r)` semantics               | **PARTIALLY FOUND** | The **shape** of `Sat` is corpus-native/frozen, and `Δ_t={r∈Req(EC_t):¬Sat(K_t,r)}` is frozen. But the corpus itself states that computing `Sat` requires `K_t`'s component semantics, which are incomplete. Therefore it is **defined in form but not computationally closed**.  |
| **G** | Decomposition-independent `Sat`      | **NOT FOUND**       | This is the principal internal F4 blocker. MD-059 explicitly identifies the missing **decomposition-independent `Sat` body**. No existing corpus result closes it.                                                                                                                |
| **H** | `K_t → K_{t+1}` transition semantics | **CONFLICTING**     | Transition/composition candidates exist, including `K_{t+1}=δ(K_t,e_t)` and the `P-12/P-13` family, but they remain unresolved. MD-059 explicitly says `Beh_F4`/`Trace_F4` are blocked by the unresolved choice among these candidates.                                           |
| **I** | F4 `Obs`                             | **PARTIALLY FOUND** | `Obs_F4` can be constructed **in form** from satisfied requirements, but cannot currently be computed because `Sat` is not closed. MD-059 calls this MATHEMATICALLY/CORPUS-DERIVED in form but **NOT COMPUTABLE**.                                                                |
| **J** | F4 `Beh`                             | **PARTIALLY FOUND** | The general `Beh` semantic slot exists, and F4's intended transition basis is known, but there is no executable/source-closed F4 `Beh`. MD-059 classifies F4 `Beh` as **UNAVAILABLE**, specifically because the transition/composition semantics remain unresolved.               |
| **K** | F4 `Trace`                           | **PARTIALLY FOUND** | General `Trace` machinery exists, but no F4-specific trace semantics/instances are available. MD-059 groups `Trace_F4` with `Beh_F4` as unavailable pending transition/composition resolution.                                                                                    |

### A–K conclusion

The important distinction is:

* **A:** there is substantial evidence of a `K_t` family, but not a complete census.
* **B/C/D:** the semantic content of that family is not reconciled.
* **E/F:** the *interfaces/formulas* exist.
* **G:** the computational closure is missing.
* **H:** transition semantics are conflicting/unresolved.
* **I:** constructible in form, not computable.
* **J/K:** general slots exist, F4-specific semantics do not.

This is exactly why MD-059 did **not** describe F4 as simply "absent": the semantic shell is real, but the semantic instantiation is incomplete.

| **L** | F3 observation semantics          | **FOUND**           | F3 has an actual source-grounded construction: `Beh_𝔠(K):=Reach(Ops(K))`, with observations derived from reached atoms. MD-058 explicitly identifies F3 as the only candidate with real instantiated semantics.  |
| **M** | F4 observation semantics          | **PARTIALLY FOUND** | F4 `Obs_F4` is formally constructible as satisfied requirements, but is not computable because `Sat` is not closed.                                                                                               |
| **N** | Atoms ↔ requirements bridge       | **NOT FOUND**       | MD-059 identifies this explicitly: F3 outputs **reached atoms**, F4 outputs **satisfied requirements**, and **no corpus document bridges these types**.                                                           |
| **O** | Common observation domain         | **NOT FOUND**       | F3 and F4 currently have different observation codomains. MD-059 states that no common `Q,𝒪` can presently be posed without inventing the missing bridge.                                                        |
| **P** | Common behaviour/trace domain     | **NOT FOUND**       | F3 has instantiated behaviour; F4 does not. F4 transition/trace semantics remain unavailable. Thus no common `Beh`/`Trace` comparison domain exists. ;                                                            |
| **Q** | Formal F3↔F4 equivalence relation | **NOT FOUND**       | MD-058 derived the *general shape* `Obs_{Q,𝒪}`-equality, but explicitly did **not** establish the corpus-intended `≡`, and its cross-candidate matrix left all 15 pairs unresolved.                              |

### Critical distinction for Q

There **is** a mathematical result from MD-058:

$$
K_1\approx_{Q,\mathcal O}K_2
\iff
Obs_{Q,\mathcal O}(K_1)=Obs_{Q,\mathcal O}(K_2).
$$

But this is **not** a completed F3↔F4 equivalence result. MD-058 explicitly says that `Q,𝒪` remain open and that this does not recover the corpus-intended stronger `≡`. 

So:

> **The equivalence machinery exists; the F3/F4 semantic inputs required to instantiate it do not.**

# 3. GA-001 / GA-038 readiness — R–T

| ID    | Higher-level objective                                             | Status        | Evidence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| **R** | Evidence sufficient for **GA-001**                                 | **NOT FOUND** | MD-058 left GA-001 unchanged: only F3 had actual semantics; no additional candidate was comparable. MD-059 sharpened this to a **type mismatch**: atoms vs requirements.                                                                            |
| **S** | Evidence sufficient for **GA-038**                                 | **NOT FOUND** | MD-023 tested canonicalization criteria and found **no corpus-justified canonicalization criterion**, with the sole positive precedent being explicit governance ratification of `Δ_t`, not mathematical selection. MD-059 left GA-038 unchanged.   |
| **T** | Evidence sufficient to compare F4 with another candidate beyond F3 | **NOT FOUND** | MD-058's complete candidate matrix had only F3 instantiated; all 15 pairwise comparisons remained unresolved. MD-059 adds partial F4 formal structure but does not create a second computable semantic candidate.                                   |

### GA-001

The current state is stronger than merely "we haven't tried enough":

**GA-001 is blocked by missing comparable semantic types**, not by lack of an equivalence formula.

MD-059 explicitly describes this as a **named type mismatch**. 

### GA-038

GA-038 is also **not a hidden computational problem** at present.

The prior study found no corpus-grounded canonicalization criterion among those tested. The successful `Δ_t` precedent demonstrates **governance ratification of an already-derived result**, rather than a general mathematical rule for selecting one `K_t`. 

Therefore GA-038 cannot legitimately be marked solved merely because F4 becomes computable.

---

# 4. Provenance audit

This is important because MD-059 itself uncovered a provenance contamination risk.

## 4.1 Evidence predating MD-058/MD-059

The following are genuinely prior inputs:

* **MD-050** — F3's `Reach(Ops(K))` construction.
* **M0043** — primary Model-B material, including `[DEF-15]`.
* **M0125** — primary source containing the `Σ_t=(A,S,R,V,C)` typed component and transition formulation.
* **M0132** — primary source that freezes the `Δ_t`/`Sat` shape and explicitly states the dependency of computing `Sat` on `K_t` component semantics.
* Earlier MD-023–057 findings reused by MD-058.

MD-058 explicitly says its requirement ledger was built from already-established findings from MD-023–057, retaining their original provenance. 

## 4.2 Evidence that consumes MD-058/MD-059

The externally supplied analysis encountered during MD-059 **must not be counted as independent corroboration**.

MD-059 established that it:

* was created the same day,
* explicitly cited MD-058,
* was therefore a response to MD-058 rather than prior evidence,
* was classified as **same-day, MD-058-consuming re-analysis**.



That classification was preserved in the handover. 

## 4.3 Same-day derivative material

The `[DEF-15]` finding is a different case.

`[DEF-15]` is in **M0043**, a primary corpus source dated 2026-09-02. MD-059 discovered it on 2026-09-09. Therefore:

* **the discovery was same-day relative to MD-059;**
* **the underlying evidence predates MD-059;**
* it is **not derivative of MD-059**.

It corrected MD-058's provenance interpretation, but did not invalidate MD-058's mathematical derivation. 

## 4.4 External analysis

The external analysis is therefore:

> **External + same-day + MD-058-consuming + non-independent.**

It is useful as a cross-check, but **not admissible as independent corroboration** of the F4 state. MD-059 explicitly applied this rule. 

## 4.5 Another research lane

There is also evidence from other research lanes, particularly the Lane-T/theory-extraction material.

MD-059 explicitly kept:

> `theory-extraction/` / Lane-T `K3` / `Ω` / `T-K1` / `T-K2`

**firewalled** throughout. 

Therefore those materials must **not silently become F4 evidence** in this handover.

---

# 5. The important state distinctions

The handover should preserve the following distinctions exactly.

### `Δ_t`

**Defined and frozen.**

$$
\boxed{
\Delta_t=\{r\in Req(EC_t):\neg Sat(K_t,r)\}
}
$$

This is not the blocker.

### `Sat(K_t,r)`

**Defined in shape, not computationally closed.**

The corpus explicitly states that its computation requires the semantics of `K_t`'s components. 

Therefore:

> **defined ≠ computable**

### `Obs_F4`

**Constructible in form, not computable.**

That is stronger than "not found" but weaker than "implemented."

### `Beh_F4` / `Trace_F4`

**General semantic slots exist; F4-specific instantiation unavailable.**

This is not simply "the corpus contains nothing." The blockage is the unresolved transition/composition semantics. 

### F3↔F4

**Not merely untested.**

It is presently **ill-typed as a comparison** because:

$$
Obs_{F3}\subseteq\text{reached atoms}
$$

while

$$
Obs_{F4}\subseteq\text{satisfied requirements}.
$$

There is no corpus-grounded mapping between these spaces. 

---

# 6. Minimal remaining dependency chain

The corpus supports the following dependency structure; I am **not introducing a new chain**:

```text

                                  by itself for canonicalization
```

The last point matters:

**F4 completion does not automatically solve GA-038.**

GA-038 concerns the absence of a justified canonicalization criterion for `K_t`; the prior evidence says the one successful closure precedent was explicit governance ratification, not mathematical selection. 

Likewise, **GA-001 cannot be reached merely by having `Obs_F4`**; the atom/requirement type mismatch still has to be resolved by admissible evidence.

---

# 7. Smallest next research act

There are **two named downstream actions**, but they are not equally fundamental.

MD-059 records:

1. reconcile the 9+ `K_t` variants enough to provide a decomposition-independent `Sat` body;
2. build the missing atoms↔requirements bridge.



For the **smallest fundamental blocker**, the first act is prior:

> ### **Research Act: establish whether the existing corpus contains sufficient evidence for a decomposition-independent `Sat(K_t,r)` semantics across the existing `K_t` variants.**

This does **not** mean reconciling the variants now. It means the next authorized research act should first determine whether such a decomposition-independent satisfaction semantics is already recoverable from the admissible corpus, and if not, identify precisely what semantic evidence is missing.

Why this is the smallest fundamental act:

* Without `Sat`, `Obs_F4` is not computable.
* Without `Obs_F4`, F4 has no comparable instantiated observation semantics.
* Without F4 semantics, the F3↔F4 comparison cannot advance.
* GA-001 therefore cannot advance through F4.
* The atoms↔requirements bridge is a **second, independent blocker**, but even a perfect bridge cannot make `Sat(K_t,r)` computable.

This ordering follows MD-059's primary-source finding rather than introducing a new theoretical dependency. 

**That research act has not been executed here.**
