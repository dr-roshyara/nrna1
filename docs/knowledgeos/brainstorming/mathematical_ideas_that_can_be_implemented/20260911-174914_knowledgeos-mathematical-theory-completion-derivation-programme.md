Yes. I reviewed the entire uploaded 1,483-line consolidation, not just the EVal section, and I would **rewrite the research programme substantially**.

The current document is correct that v1.3 is not mathematically closed, but its “four packages” are still too coarse. 

The key change I recommend is:

> **Do not research “EVal”, “Det”, “δ”, etc. as isolated concepts. Research the mathematical derivations that connect them, and prove necessity/sufficiency at every boundary.**

Below is the version I would use as the new research specification.

# KnowledgeOS — Mathematical Theory Completion & Derivation Programme

## 0. Executive position

The current KnowledgeOS research does **not** suffer from a lack of mathematical notation.

The principal remaining problem is the existence of several **unresolved semantic bridges** between objects that are already structurally identified.

The current status is therefore:

$$
\boxed{
\text{Structural foundation substantially reconstructed}
}
$$

but:

$$
\boxed{
\text{Semantic algebra and minimality are not yet closed}
}
$$

The research must now move from broad concept discovery to **controlled mathematical derivation and falsification**.

The objective is not to invent missing semantics.

The objective is:

$$
\boxed{
\text{Corpus evidence}
\rightarrow
\text{candidate semantic structure}
\rightarrow
\text{mathematical derivation}
\rightarrow
\text{counterexample search}
\rightarrow
\text{validated result}
}
$$

No candidate becomes canonical merely because it is mathematically elegant.

---

# 1. Current established foundation

The following should be treated as the current foundation, subject to the evidence already established in the corpus.

## 1.1 Inquiry and context determine required distinctions

$$
\boxed{
\mathcal R_{\rm req}(Q,\Gamma)\subseteq\mathcal D
}
$$

Required distinctions originate from the inquiry/context rather than from a preselected kernel representation.

This is one of the strongest corrections because it removes the circular structure:

$$
Kernel
\rightarrow
Required\ Distinctions
\rightarrow
Kernel.
$$

The preferred direction is:

$$
(Q,\Gamma)
\rightarrow
\mathcal R_{\rm req}
\rightarrow
Adequacy
\rightarrow
Candidate\ Architecture.
$$

This is currently regarded as closed.

---

## 1.2 Epistemic stages must remain distinct

The following separation is established as a constitutional principle:

$$
\boxed{
Truth
\neq
Evaluation
\neq
Determination
\neq
Decision
}
$$

and:

$$
Evaluation
\rightarrow
Determination
\rightarrow
Decision
\rightarrow
Authorization
\rightarrow
Action.
$$

The existence of the interfaces is established more strongly than their complete mathematical semantics.

Therefore:

$$
\text{separation}=\text{closed}
$$

but:

$$
EVal\rightarrow Det=\text{open}.
$$

---

## 1.3 Contradiction must not cause global explosion

$$
\boxed{
Contr(p)\not\Rightarrow Explosion
}
$$

is a constitutional requirement.

However:

$$
Contr
$$

itself and:

$$
Scope(Contr,\Gamma)
$$

remain only partially defined.

Therefore:

$$
NonExplosion=\text{closed}
$$

but:

$$
Contr,\ Scope=\text{open/partial}.
$$

---

## 1.4 State transition is history-preserving, not epistemically monotone

The current strongest candidate is:

$$
K_{t+1}
=
\delta(K_t,o,\Gamma).
$$

A structural preservation condition may be:

$$
V(K_t)\subseteq V(K_{t+1})
$$

and:

$$
H(K_t)\subseteq H(K_{t+1}).
$$

This must **not** be interpreted as:

$$
K_t\preceq K_{t+1}.
$$

A retraction may change epistemic standing while preserving history.

Therefore the preferred term is:

$$
\boxed{\text{History-Preserving State Transition}}
$$

rather than “monotonic knowledge”.

The uploaded review explicitly identifies this distinction.

---

# 2. The fundamental research question

The remaining theory can now be represented as a dependency graph:

$$
\boxed{
EVal
\rightarrow
Det
\rightarrow
Adequacy
\rightarrow
Equivalence
\rightarrow
Kernel\ Reduction
}
$$

with a second branch:

$$
\boxed{
Contr
\rightarrow
Scope
\rightarrow
ISOLATE
\rightarrow
\delta
\rightarrow
Composition
}
$$

and both ultimately meet at:

$$
\boxed{
\text{preservation of required distinctions}
}
$$

This is the central mathematical research problem.

---

# 3. DERIVATION D1 — Required Distinction Formalization

### Question

What exactly is a distinction?

The corpus has used more than one mathematical representation, including:

$$
d=(x,y),\qquad x\not\equiv_{\rm sem}y
$$

and equivalence-relation/partition-based formulations.

These must not be silently combined.

### Research

Determine whether a KnowledgeOS distinction is formally:

1. a pair of distinguishable states;
2. an equivalence-class separation;
3. a predicate;
4. a relation;
5. another structure.

### Required derivation

Establish a formal object:

$$
\mathcal D
$$

and:

$$
\mathcal R_{\rm req}(Q,\Gamma)\subseteq\mathcal D.
$$

### Falsification

Construct representations that preserve:

* identity,
* provenance,
* contradiction,
* temporal distinction,
* contextual distinction,

and determine which representation of \(d\) is actually required.

### Output

A formally defined distinction universe.

---

# 4. DERIVATION D2 — Preservation

Once \(\mathcal D\) exists, derive:

$$
Preserved(R,\Gamma)\subseteq\mathcal D.
$$

The central question is:

> When has a representation preserved a distinction?

Candidate:

$$
d\in Preserved(R,\Gamma)
$$

iff the representation contains enough information to distinguish the semantically different cases relevant to \(d\).

This must be formally tested.

### Critical question

For:

$$
\pi:X\rightarrow Y
$$

define the induced identification:

$$
x_1\sim_\pi x_2
\iff
\pi(x_1)=\pi(x_2).
$$

Then investigate:

$$
x_1\not\equiv_{\rm sem}x_2
\quad\land\quad
x_1\sim_\pi x_2.
$$

If this occurs, the representation has collapsed a required distinction.

This may become the mathematical foundation for the later adequacy theory.

---

# 5. DERIVATION D3 — Minimal valuation structure

This is the first major EVal derivation.

Do **not** assume FDE as KnowledgeOS ontology.

Investigate the minimal structure required to preserve support/opposition distinctions.

Candidate:

$$
V_1=\{0,1\}
$$

versus:

$$
V_2=\{0,1\}\times\{0,1\}.
$$

The second representation preserves two independent polarities:

$$
v(r)=(v^+(r),v^-(r)).
$$

It has four combinations:

$$
(0,0),(1,0),(0,1),(1,1).
$$

These can be represented by FDE labels:

$$
N,T,F,B.
$$

But the research question is:

$$
\boxed{
\text{Does KnowledgeOS require the four values,
or merely the two independent polarities?}
}
$$

### Required result

Either:

$$
\boxed{
\text{two polarities are necessary and sufficient for the tested distinction universe}
}
$$

or a counterexample showing that more structure is required.

Only afterwards should FDE be evaluated as a representation.

---

# 6. DERIVATION D4 — EVal information sufficiency

Now determine what EVal actually needs to preserve.

Do not begin with a predetermined tuple.

Investigate whether:

$$
EVal
=
\langle
V,P,W,B,C,\ldots
\rangle
$$

is necessary.

Potential components include:

* valuation/standing \(V\),
* provenance \(P\),
* warrant \(W\),
* boundary \(B\),
* context \(C\).

Every component must be tested.

### Necessity test

Remove one component:

$$
EVal^{-P}
$$

and ask whether two semantically distinct cases collapse.

If:

$$
E_1\not\equiv E_2
$$

but:

$$
EVal^{-P}(E_1)
=
EVal^{-P}(E_2),
$$

then \(P\) is necessary for the tested distinction universe.

Perform the same experiment for every proposed component.

### Desired output

$$
\boxed{
EVal_{\min}
}
$$

for the currently established distinction universe.

This is a much stronger target than simply declaring an EVal tuple.

---

# 7. DERIVATION D5 — Provenance versus warrant

This must be explicitly separated.

The existence of provenance:

$$
P\neq\varnothing
$$

does not mathematically imply epistemic adequacy.

Therefore research separately:

$$
Provenance(e)
$$

and:

$$
Warrant(e,r,\Gamma).
$$

Construct at least:

$$
T+\text{provenance}
$$

versus:

$$
T+\text{provenance but inadequate warrant}.
$$

If both produce the same determination, warrant may not belong in `Det`.

If they differ, warrant is semantically relevant.

This is an important unresolved derivation.

---

# 8. DERIVATION D6 — EVal aggregation

If EVal contains multiple evidence items, determine whether aggregation is even required.

If required, define:

$$
\bigoplus_\Gamma:
\mathcal E^*\rightharpoonup\mathcal E.
$$

Do not assume:

$$
S^+ - S^-
$$

or any numerical measure.

First determine whether support is:

* cardinal,
* ordinal,
* probabilistic,
* weighted,
* relational,
* set-valued,
* lattice-valued,
* or another structure.

Then investigate algebraic properties:

$$
Associativity
$$

$$
Commutativity
$$

$$
Idempotence
$$

$$
Monotonicity
$$

$$
Partiality.
$$

The current document explicitly identifies aggregation as open.

---

# 9. DERIVATION D7 — Determination semantics

Only now investigate:

$$
Det:
\mathcal E\times Q\times\Gamma
\rightharpoonup
\mathcal D_t.
$$

Do not initially force:

$$
Det\in\{0,1\}.
$$

First determine what a `Determination` mathematically is.

Possible structure must come from evidence, not invention.

The investigation must answer:

* What constitutes determination?
* What constitutes insufficiency?
* What constitutes conflict?
* What constitutes unresolved theory?
* What constitutes boundary?
* Is determination single-valued or set-valued?
* Is determination query-relative?
* Does adjudication change the evaluation or merely interpret it?

---

# 10. DERIVATION D8 — FDE → Determination bridge

Now test the specific hypothesis:

$$
D_0(v)=
\begin{cases}
1 & v\in\{T,F\}\\
0 & v\in\{B,N\}.
\end{cases}
$$

This is **not a theorem yet**.

It is a candidate hypothesis.

Use the witness suite:

| Witness | Valuation | Provenance  | Resolution              | Question                    |
| ------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| W1      | \(T\)     | strong      | none                    | determined?                 |
| W2      | \(F\)     | strong      | none                    | determined?                 |
| W3      | \(B\)     | conflicting | unresolved              | determined?                 |
| W4      | \(N\)     | none        | unresolved              | determined?                 |
| W5      | \(T\)     | absent      | none                    | valuation alone sufficient? |
| W6      | \(B\)     | conflict    | adjudicated             | can B become determined?    |
| W7      | \(N\)     | none        | outside \(R_{\rm req}\) | is it a gap?                |

The purpose is not to prove \(D_0\).

The purpose is to **destroy \(D_0\) if the corpus permits a counterexample**.

---

# 11. DERIVATION D9 — Factivity

This should remain an independent semantic question.

Do not derive:

$$
Det\Rightarrow Truth.
$$

The established separation is:

$$
Truth\neq Det.
$$

Research whether KnowledgeOS requires:

$$
Factivity
$$

as a property of knowledge attribution, determination, evaluation, or another layer.

The important point is that:

$$
Det(F)=1
$$

may be perfectly coherent if `F` means “determined false/refuted”.

But that interpretation must be established rather than imported from FDE.

---

# 12. DERIVATION D10 — Gap derivation

Only after EVal and Det are understood should we derive:

$$
\Delta(Q,\Gamma,K).
$$

The important correction is:

$$
N\not\Rightarrow r\in\Delta.
$$

Instead the requirement must first be relevant:

$$
r\in\mathcal R_{\rm req}(Q,\Gamma).
$$

Then determine what unresolved means.

Candidate:

$$
\Delta(Q,\Gamma,K)
=
\{r\in\mathcal R_{\rm req}(Q,\Gamma):
Unresolved(EVal(K,r,\Gamma))\}.
$$

This remains a candidate until `Unresolved` is formally derived.

---

# 13. DERIVATION D11 — Determination ontology

Separate the mathematical object `Determination` from the predicate “determined”.

These are different questions.

For example:

$$
DetResult
$$

might be an object, while:

$$
Determined(d)
$$

might be a predicate.

Do not automatically make:

$$
Determination=
(Status,Confidence,Risk,Actionability).
$$

The uploaded review correctly identifies the existing formulation as overextended, particularly because `Actionability` leaks downstream governance semantics into determination. 

A cleaner research direction is:

$$
Determination
=
\langle
Status,
Basis,
Scope,
Uncertainty,
Provenance
\rangle
$$

but this is **a candidate to investigate**, not a definition to ratify.

---

# 14. DERIVATION D12 — Decision boundary

Once determination exists, formally establish:

$$
Determination
\rightarrow
Decision.
$$

The theory must preserve:

$$
Determination\neq Decision.
$$

Then:

$$
Decision
\rightarrow
Authorization
\rightarrow
Action.
$$

This prevents governance concepts such as `PERMITTED` from being silently embedded in epistemic determination.

---

# 15. DERIVATION D13 — Operation identity

Before declaring:

$$
O_{\rm core}
=
\{ASSERT,LINK,REVISE,RETRACT,ISOLATE\},
$$

define what an operation acts upon.

This is currently unresolved.

In particular:

$$
Proposition
\neq
Assertion
\neq
Evidence
\neq
Evaluation
\neq
Determination.
$$

Therefore investigate the operation target:

$$
target(o).
$$

For each operation derive:

$$
Pre_o
$$

$$
Input_o
$$

$$
Post_o
$$

$$
Invariant_o
$$

$$
Provenance_o
$$

$$
Failure_o
$$

$$
Partiality_o.
$$

The uploaded review identifies this as a major problem with generic `ASSERT` and `REVISE`. 

---

# 16. DERIVATION D14 — State transition δ

Then derive:

$$
\delta:
K\times O\times\Gamma
\rightharpoonup
K.
$$

For each operation:

$$
K'=\delta(K,o,\Gamma).
$$

Prove which invariants hold.

Especially distinguish:

$$
History(K)\subseteq History(K')
$$

from:

$$
Knowledge(K)\preceq Knowledge(K').
$$

The former may be supported.

The latter must not be assumed.

---

# 17. DERIVATION D15 — Lifecycle semantics

Explicitly investigate:

$$
Retracted
\neq
Superseded
\neq
Invalidated
\neq
Expired
\neq
Withdrawn.
$$

These must either be:

1. distinct semantic states;
2. different relations;
3. different events;
4. or demonstrably reducible to a smaller structure.

This is essential for δ and equivalence.

---

# 18. DERIVATION D16 — Contradiction

Define:

$$
Contr_\Gamma(x,y).
$$

Then investigate its mathematical properties:

### Symmetry

$$
Contr(x,y)\Rightarrow Contr(y,x)?
$$

### Irreflexivity

$$
\neg Contr(x,x)?
$$

### Context dependence

$$
Contr_\Gamma(x,y)
\not\Rightarrow
Contr_{\Gamma'}(x,y).
$$

### Temporal dependence

$$
Contr_{t}(x,y)
$$

versus:

$$
Contr_{t'}(x,y).
$$

Do not equate:

$$
B
$$

with:

$$
Contr.
$$

`B` may represent conflicting polarity; contradiction is a relation whose semantics still need derivation.

---

# 19. DERIVATION D17 — Scope and isolation

Derive:

$$
Scope(Contr,\Gamma).
$$

Then investigate:

$$
ISOLATE(K,p,\Gamma).
$$

The important test is not:

> “Is the clean node absent from the firewall set?”

The actual semantic test is whether the isolation preserves the required determination distinctions outside the affected scope.

For example:

$$
q\notin Scope(Contr(p),\Gamma)
$$

should be connected to preservation of whatever epistemic property is actually established—not prematurely to `Actionability`.

The current implementation was correctly criticized for testing only a weaker structural property. 

---

# 20. DERIVATION D18 — Composition algebra

Now investigate:

$$
\circ:
O\times O\rightharpoonup O.
$$

Determine:

### Identity

$$
\exists e:\quad e\circ o=o\circ e=o?
$$

### Associativity

$$
(o_3\circ o_2)\circ o_1
=
o_3\circ(o_2\circ o_1)?
$$

### Commutativity

Probably not generally:

$$
o_2\circ o_1
\neq
o_1\circ o_2.
$$

But this alone does not characterize the algebra.

Also derive:

* invalid composition;
* precondition propagation;
* retraction/revision composition;
* isolation composition;
* provenance propagation.

The current document correctly identifies composition as open. 

---

# 21. DERIVATION D19 — Contextual observational equivalence

Do **not** begin with general semantic equivalence.

Define:

$$
K_1
\approx_{Q,\Gamma,O}
K_2
$$

if they produce the same observations under a defined observation regime.

Then prove whether:

$$
\approx
$$

is:

* reflexive;
* symmetric;
* transitive.

Only afterwards ask whether it can support:

$$
K_1\equiv_{\rm sem}K_2.
$$

The uploaded review correctly warns that identical current determinations do not establish equality of provenance, future behavior, revision behavior, contradiction behavior, or authorization implications. 

---

# 22. DERIVATION D20 — Congruence under operations

This is a particularly important derivation that should be added to the previous four-package plan.

If:

$$
K_1\approx K_2,
$$

does it follow that:

$$
\delta(K_1,o,\Gamma)
\approx
\delta(K_2,o,\Gamma)?
$$

If yes, observational equivalence may be a **congruence** with respect to operations.

If no, then the observation regime is too weak for state reduction.

This is potentially crucial for kernel reduction.

---

# 23. DERIVATION D21 — Adequacy

Now derive:

$$
Adequate(K,Q,\Gamma).
$$

The strongest current candidate is:

$$
\boxed{
Adequate(R,Q,\Gamma)
\iff
\mathcal R_{\rm req}(Q,\Gamma)
\subseteq
Preserved(R,\Gamma)
}
$$

but this should be treated as a candidate theorem to validate from the distinction/preservation work.

This is where the theory becomes mathematically coherent:

$$
Required
\rightarrow
Preserved
\rightarrow
Adequate.
$$

---

# 24. DERIVATION D22 — Executable adequacy

Only after mathematical adequacy exists:

$$
EA(K,\mathcal O,Q,\Gamma)
$$

can be derived.

A candidate form is:

$$
Adequacy(K,Q,\Gamma)
\land
\forall o\in\mathcal O:
Preserved(\delta(K,o,\Gamma),\Gamma)
\supseteq
\mathcal R_{\rm req}(Q,\Gamma).
$$

But the implementation must actually evaluate the mathematical predicates.

The previous CLOSURE-5 test failed this requirement because the declared `R_req` was not the same as what the implementation actually tested. 

---

# 25. DERIVATION D23 — Complexity

Do not use a fixed runtime threshold to establish asymptotic complexity.

To derive:

$$
T(n,m)\in O(n+m),
$$

either:

1. prove the algorithmic complexity analytically; or
2. conduct systematic scaling experiments consistent with a stated computational model.

A single:

$$
elapsed<0.05
$$

only establishes a benchmark result for the tested instance.

The uploaded review explicitly rejects the previous complexity inference. 

---

# 26. DERIVATION D24 — Determinism

Separate:

$$
ImplementationDeterminism
$$

from:

$$
ConstitutionalDeterminism.
$$

Replay tests can establish:

$$
Replay(K_0,\mu)=K_t
$$

for the tested implementation.

They do not automatically establish a theorem about every implementation of the architecture.

This distinction is already supported by the current review. 

---

# 27. DERIVATION D25 — Candidate architecture space

Only now define:

$$
\mathcal A
=
\{\text{admissible candidate architectures}\}.
$$

This must be independent of ABK-1.

Otherwise:

$$
ABK\!-\!1
\rightarrow
defines\ criteria
\rightarrow
passes\ criteria
$$

creates circularity.

The correct direction is:

$$
\mathcal R_{\rm req}
\rightarrow
Adequacy
\rightarrow
Independent\ tests
\rightarrow
\mathcal A
\rightarrow
Evidence.
$$

The review identifies exactly this circularity. 

---

# 28. DERIVATION D26 — Minimality

Only after \(\mathcal A\) and adequacy exist should we define:

$$
A_1\preceq A_2.
$$

This is the mathematical meaning of “smaller/minimal”.

Then:

$$
A^*\text{ is minimal}
$$

iff:

$$
Adequate(A^*)
$$

and:

$$
\nexists A\in\mathcal A:
A\prec A^*
\land
Adequate(A).
$$

Only here can the question:

$$
\boxed{
ABK\!-\!1\text{ is minimal?}
}
$$

be answered.

The current four-candidate experiment cannot establish unique minimality. 

---

# 29. DERIVATION D27 — Kernel reduction

Finally investigate:

$$
MinKer.
$$

The real question is:

> What is the smallest representation and operation system capable of preserving all distinctions required by the problem class?

Formally:

$$
K^*
=
\arg\min_{K\in\mathcal A}
Complexity(K)
$$

subject to:

$$
Adequate(K,Q,\Gamma)
$$

for the defined problem class.

This should be a **result of the theory**, not an assumption used to construct the theory.

---

# 30. The resulting dependency graph

The complete derivation programme is therefore:

$$
\boxed{
D1\ Distinction
}
$$

$$
\downarrow
$$

$$
\boxed{
D2\ Preservation
}
$$

$$
\downarrow
$$

$$
\boxed{
D3\ Minimal\ Polarity
}
$$

$$

$$

$$
\boxed{

$$
\boxed{

while independently:

$$
\boxed{

Then:

$$

# 31. What should NOT be researched now

To prevent another premature closure, the following should **not** currently be treated as research objectives:

### Do not start by proving

$$
FDE=\text{KnowledgeOS logic}.
$$

### Do not start by proving

$$
Det(T)=Det(F)=1.
$$

### Do not assume

$$
N=Gap.
$$

### Do not assume

$$
B=Contr.
$$

### Do not assume

$$
Provenance\Rightarrow Warrant.
$$

### Do not assume

$$
\text{Determination}\Rightarrow Actionability.
$$

### Do not assume

$$
Nodes(K_t)\subseteq Nodes(K_{t+1})
\Rightarrow
K_t\preceq K_{t+1}.
$$

### Do not assume

$$
Observational\ Equivalence
=
Semantic\ Equivalence.
$$

### Do not assume

$$
ABK\!-\!1
=
MinimalKernel.
$$

These are precisely the kinds of semantic promotions that caused the previous closure problem.

# 32. The five genuinely decisive mathematical questions

Although there are 27 derivations above, they collapse into **five major mathematical questions**:

### M1 — What information must be preserved?

$$
\boxed{
\mathcal D,\ Preserved,\ \mathcal R_{\rm req}
}
$$

### M2 — What is an epistemic evaluation?

$$
\boxed{
EVal_{\min}
}
$$

including whether FDE is fundamental or merely representational.

### M3 — When does an evaluation constitute a determination?

$$
\boxed{
EVal\rightarrow Det
}
$$

without importing probability, truth, or governance semantics.

### M4 — How do knowledge representations change and compose?

$$
\boxed{
\delta,\ Contr,\ Scope,\ O,\circ,\approx
}
$$

### M5 — What is the minimal adequate kernel?

$$
\boxed{
Adequacy
\rightarrow
\mathcal A
\rightarrow
Minimality
\rightarrow
Kernel
}
$$

---

# 33. The most important methodological rule

Every derivation should have four layers:

$$
\boxed{
\text{Corpus Evidence}
}
$$

$$
\downarrow
$$

$$
\boxed{
\text{Candidate Mathematical Statement}
}
$$

$$
\downarrow
$$

$$
\boxed{
\text{Proof / Counterexample / Experiment}
}
$$

$$
\downarrow
$$

$$
\boxed{
\text{Status}
}
$$

where status must be one of:

* **DERIVED**
* **PROVED IN TESTED SCOPE**
* **EMPIRICALLY SUPPORTED**
* **CANDIDATE**
* **OPEN**
* **FALSIFIED**
* **REJECTED**
* **UNDEFINED**

This prevents the recurring error:

$$
\text{implementation passes}
\Rightarrow
\text{mathematical theorem}.
$$

The current review demonstrates why this separation is necessary. 

---

# 34. Final target

The ultimate objective should **not** be:

> “Complete the list of KnowledgeOS concepts.”

It should be:

$$
\boxed{
\textbf{Derive a closed mathematical system in which every required semantic distinction,
state transformation, evaluation, determination and adequacy relation has a defined
domain, codomain, semantics and preservation law.}
}
$$

Only then should we ask whether a minimal kernel exists.

And only after that should we ask whether:

$$
\boxed{ABK\!-\!1}

is that kernel.

At the current stage, therefore:

$$
\boxed{
\text{Discovery: CLOSED}
}
$$

$$
\boxed{
\text{Constitutional principles: substantially established}
}
$$

$$
\boxed{
\text{Semantic derivations: IN PROGRESS}
}
$$

$$
\boxed{
\text{Kernel candidate: ABK-1 — not yet proven}
}
$$

$$
\boxed{
\text{Minimal kernel: OPEN}
}
$$

$$
\boxed{
\text{Theory v1.3: NOT READY}
}
$$

The immediate highest-priority derivation is **D1 → D4 → D7 → D8**:

$$
\boxed{
\text{Distinction}
\rightarrow
\text{Preservation}
\rightarrow
\text{minimal EVal structure}
\rightarrow
EVal\rightarrow Det
}
$$

because that sequence answers the most fundamental unresolved question: **what information must KnowledgeOS preserve before it can legitimately claim that something has been determined?**

### My recommendation for the next Claude research round

Do **not** ask Claude to work on all 27 derivations at once. That would recreate the broad-research problem.

Give it this first controlled package:

$$
\boxed{\textbf{D1–D8: Distinction → Preservation → EVal → Determination}}
$$

with one strict instruction:

> **Do not introduce any new semantic primitive unless the corpus requires it or a mathematical counterexample demonstrates that the existing structure is insufficient.**

The particularly important experiment is to determine whether **FDE is actually required**, or whether the deeper invariant is simply **independent preservation of positive and negative epistemic standing**. That question sits underneath the entire EVal/Det problem.
