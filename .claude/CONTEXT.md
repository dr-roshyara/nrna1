# Current Working State

**Updated:** 2026-07-07

## Active Work (structured — hooks parse these `Key:` lines; keep the format)
Ticket: PB-003
Plan: .claude/plans/PB-003-inbox.md
Branch: feature/pb003 (ACTIVE — baseline-release-1.1 tagged behind it)
Milestone: M1 — Messaging Infrastructure (49%, derived 17/35 WBS)
Priority: High

- **Detail:** PB-003 Inbox / Deduplication · Lifecycle: **VERIFIED / CERTIFIED (ARR, 2026-07-07)** · 18/18 WBS · ARR: `docs/implementation/PB-003_Architecture_Readiness_Report.md` · matrix: `docs/implementation/Messaging_Architecture_Verification.md`. **Next ticket: PB-004 (needs IDD).**

## What remains (EPIC-001)
PB-003 (Inbox) → **Platform Capability Certification (D-11 gate)** → PB-004 (Election Reaction, needs IDD) → PB-005 (Contestation Reaction, needs IDD) → PB-006 (IT-1..8) → PB-007 (Merge Gate incl. F-1 Deptrac, F-2 Infection)

## Blockers
None. PB-003 is Verified/Certified; PB-004 is unblocked (needs its IDD first).

## Next action (exactly one)
**AWAIT ARB ruling on DD-4** (domain investigation done): a `Challenge` is scoped to **exactly one Election** — a real but currently **implicit** invariant (Contestation's `Challenge` owns an opaque `TargetRef`, no materialized `electionId`). Domain-inward resolution = **materialize** the existing fact (Challenge/Determination published language + `DeterminationIssued v2`, ADR-T5) — a cross-context Contestation+Adjudication **prerequisite** needing an ADR + ARB approval; read-model is the fallback. Anonymity-safe (electionId ≠ voter linkage). **PB-004 RED is BLOCKED on this DD-4 prerequisite** (not on Messaging — ARR consume-only stands). Event Storming ✔; IDD drafted (minor ARB refinements applied: provider rename; aggregate-name validate-during-RED). Do NOT write code; do NOT modify the frozen Messaging Platform. On the DD-4 ruling → (prereq ADR/impl if materialize) → PB-004 RED (C1 Domain).

## Architecture debt (tracked)
- **AD-M1 — RESOLVED (2026-07-07) · category: Architecture Fitness Evolution** (no domain change — only *where* the fitness guard lives). Anonymity guard relocated to the constitutional suite (`GreenfieldCoreArchitectureTest::test_at_q7_001_no_voter_vote_linkage` now scans the Shared messaging surface incl. Outbox); property #11 removed from the Inbox test. RED→GREEN proven; Architecture suite 142✔/1 skip; greenfield PHPStan clean. First fitness change validating PGP-03.
- **AD-M2** — decide Outbox formal Application port / hexagonal symmetry (ADR-MP-05/Q5) — future ADR, only under business pressure.
- **G-1** (trivial, pending) — release numbering for the governance addition ("AKB 1.2" collides with roadmap §4); tag neutralized; recommend a non-colliding tag.

## Parallel tracks (not active this session)
- Governance: 38D-02 Capability Relationships (after ARB digests 38D-01)
- Docs candidates: Domain Model Catalogue · root CLAUDE.md tech-table refresh

## Automation (hooks, .claude/settings.json — see .claude/scripts/README.md)
- SessionStart auto-injects MEMORY.md + CONTEXT.md + the active plan THIS FILE declares (first `.claude/plans/*.md` path above) + today's log. Stop prints a sync report when state is stale. PostToolUse(Write|Edit) records modified files to `.claude/runtime/YYYY-MM-DD-files.log` + `-state.json` (gitignored) and refreshes plan `Last Updated:` headers.
